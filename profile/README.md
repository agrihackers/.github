We are a group of [hackers](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html), but also farmers and beekeepers, makers and builders, artists and crafters, researchers, scientists and engineers, etc. We are working together to create open technologies for agriculture.

In the projects in this GitHub organisation, we explore our interests not only in farming, but also in veterinary science and medicine, animal cognition, computer vision, and highly distributed systems.

To say hello and find out what we're up to, join [our mailing list](https://groups.io/g/agrihackers).
